# Muhamad Hariyanto's Quality Assurance Portfolio
## Profile
Hello, my name is Muhamad Hariyanto, a fresh graduate with almost 1 year experience in game development. Since a kid, I always have interest in video game, especially a co-op game. As time went on, I decided to join in game development, building and testing games, gaining experience from it. I like every type of game, but co-op game is still my favourite. I have a lot of knowledge on games and gaming and their communities, giving me technical knowledge of game functionality, errors, bugs, solutions, and feedbacks in the precise way to help creating a good products for public usage.
